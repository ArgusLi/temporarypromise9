Simple script inspired by Shantnu's Redditbot (https://github.com/shantnu/RedditBot/")
This script when run, scans the 20 newest comments on r/canucks
If the word "messier" is found, the script replies to that comment with "FUCK MESSIER!"
The script detects when a comment that contains "messier" has already been replied to, including its own messages
